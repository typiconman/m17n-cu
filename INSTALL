Description
=============================

The package that you have downloaded contains Church Slavic keyboard drivers
for Intelligent Input Bus (IBus), an input method framework for GNU/Linux and 
other Unix-like Operating Systems. The package works by adding Church Slavic
data to the  m17n library, which realizes multilingualization for 
GNU-Linux/Unix applications.

If you use Microsoft Windows or Apple OS X, this is NOT the package you need. 
Please see https://sci.ponomar.net/ for software for other operating systems.

Installation Instructions
=============================

Step 0. Installation on Debain-based systems can now be done
via the SCI repository. See https://sci.ponomar.net/keyboard.html
for more information.

Step 1. On other systems (Fedora, CentOS, etc.), you can do a manual install.
Download and install the the ibus-m17n package.
On most distributions, this can be done from the package manager, e.g.,
on Debian-based systems:

$ sudo apt-get install ibus-m17n 

But you can also download the latest source code from here:
https://github.com/ibus/ibus/wiki

and follow the installation instructions there.

Step 2. Set IBus to be your default input method
This is done by running:

$ im-config

and selecting ibus

Step 3. Check that your m17n library installation is sane.
The m17n data should be installed in your /usr/share/m17n/ directory:

$ ls /usr/share/m17n/

If not, you will need to find your m17n data directory and set 
DESTDIR in Step 4 to the appropriate directory.

Step 4. Install the Slavonic m17n data:

In the directory where you have downloaded the files of this package, run:

$ sudo make install DESTDIR=/

This copies the Church Slavonic data into /usr/share/m17n/.

Step 5. Log out from your session and log back in. Actually, this is probably 
unnecessary, and it may be sufficient to just run:

$ ibus restart

IBus will re-read the m17n data directory and find the newly installed data files.

Step 6. Load the keyboard layout(s) you wish to use

Run:

$ ibus-setup

On the Input Method tab, check Customize active input methods.
Click on Select input method.
Click on Show all input methods.
Scroll down and select: 
* For Church Slavic input method:
   Church Slavic; Old Slavonic; Old Church Slavonic
   Select the kbd (m17n) variant (for Cyrillic)
   or the glag (m17n) variatn (for Glagolitic) <--- THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL
* For Russian Extended input method:
   Russian
   Select the ext (m17n) variant (for standard Russian ЙЦУКЕН)
   or the phonext (m17n) variant (for phonetic Russian ЯВЕРТЫ)
Click Add
Click Close

Installation should be complete.

Usage instructions
============================

By default, IBus can be turned off and on by hitting Ctrl+Space.

By default, you can switch between input methods by hitting Ctrl+Shift+Space.

You can customize these keyboard shortcuts by running:

$ ibus-setup

and changing the options on the General tab.

The key mappings are described in detail in
https://www.ponomar.net/files/docen.pdf.

If you are doing serious work typesetting Church Slavonic, you should read
Unicode Technical Note 41 available at
https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn41/
so that you don't make silly mistakes.

We also suggest installing Ponomar Unicode and other Unicode fonts
available at https://sci.ponomar.net/fonts.html.


Modification instructions
============================

This software is FREE SOFTWARE, and that means that you are free to
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Should you choose to modify the keyboard layout, note that:

The file that contains the input method data is the .mim file 
(for example, for the Church Slavonic layout, cu-kbd.mim).
It is written in a LIPS-like language.
The format is fairly self-explanatory.
For details, see the m17n library documentation at:
http://www.nongnu.org/m17n/

Good luck.

Uninstallation instructions
============================

Should you wish to remove the software:

Step 0. If you used the package manager, it is as simple as:

$ sudo apt-get remove m17n-cu

Step 1. Otherwise:

Run 

$ ibus-setup

Go to the Input Method tab
Click on Church Slavic; Old Slavonic; Old Church Slavonic - kbd (m17n); (or Russian - ext (m17n))
Click Remove
Click Close

Step 2.

You can get rid of IBus by running

$ im-config

and selecting a different input method.

Step 3.

You can get rid of the m17n Slavonic data by running:

$ sudo make uninstall DESTDIR=/

from the directory where you downloaded the source code.

Or you can delete the files by hand from your m17n data directory,
which is usually /usr/share/m17n/

You assume all responsibility for any rm commands you run as sudo.
Please be careful. You can do damage to your system.
