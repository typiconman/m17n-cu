Church Slavic data for m17n database

This repository contains data for Church Slavic multilingualization for GNU-Linux/Unix applications via the m17n library and m17n database. See http://www.nongnu.org/m17n/ for more information.

The following is supported:
* Language data for Church Slavic
* Church Slavic localization for GNU/Linux
* Church Slavic input methods for IBUS / m17n
  (This is probably the **only** part that is really useful for you, the user).

This software is part of the Ponomar Project's Slavonic Computing Initiative. See http://www.ponomar.net/cu_support.html for more information.
